# hello
 
 I'm a master actuarial student at the University of Melbourne and here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12KocIZ8pINRV6OZwyKQZtQVa2Yq7v6yV).
 
I have developed great interest in machine learning and deep learning after I did a subject in Data Mining, so i thought of continuing my journey of data analysis and using GitHub as a way of keeping track of my learning progress. The repo "deep-learning" records all my learning process and hopefully I will be able to create more interesting projects after my studying.
